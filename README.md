### What can this bot do?

- This bot has no moderation - as in moderation has been removed
- This bot can perform everything chatGPT can
- This bot has memory
- This bot has scientific knowledge

### Limitations?

- This code will probably only work while OpenAI keeps their research preview of chatGPT open
- This bot needs to be deployed by yourself on a server/computer to keep working (I run a `forever` process on my personal server - feel free to use @chatGPT\_tg\_bot) on telegram
- This bot requires you to obtain an OpenAI session token if you are deploying it yourself as well as a telegram bot token (by creating your bot with the `botfather` bot/tool on telegram) - the simple instructions on obtaining these tokens are in the comments in the code
